# ⚙️ Verilog HDL Practice Repository

This is my personal Verilog HDL practice repository. I'm just beginning my journey into digital logic design and hardware description languages, and this space is where I'll be exploring and collecting my first Verilog codes.

I'm currently learning through platforms like EDA Playground and HDLBits. I haven't added many files yet — but as I progress, I'll be uploading basic combinational and sequential circuit designs, and gradually move toward more complex modules.

## What to Expect
Right now:  
- Just setting things up  
- Learning syntax, structure, and simulation basics  

Coming soon:  
- Basic logic gates  
- Simple adders, flip-flops, and counters  
- Small testbenches to verify behavior  

## Tools I'm Using
- [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com)
- [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net)

This repository is a work-in-progress, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing from here. Suggestions and learning tips are always welcome!
